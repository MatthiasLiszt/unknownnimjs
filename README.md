# unknownnimjs
unknown nim game variation implemented in react.js ... tried to be as functional as I could 

## installation

this uses webpacked react.js , so please ignorse bundle.js and go straight for the source code which ends with *.jsx

if everthing is setup correctly and the package.json is error-free you can run it with 'npm install' and then 'npm run'and 
then you have to still load the page which is /src/client/index.html ... or just wait until the codepen version is ready
