# unknownnimjs

unknown nim game variation implemented in react.js ... tried to be as functional as I could 
(this means I avoided successfully any kind of classical loop)

## installation

this uses webpacked react.js , so please ignorse bundle.js and go straight for the source code which ends with *.jsx

if everthing is setup correctly and the package.json is error-free you can run it with 'npm install' and then 'npm run'and 
then you have to still load the page which is /src/client/index.html ... or just wait until the codepen version is ready

## How To Play

The object of the game is to make the last possible move. Every move you occupy fields.
There are a total of 16 fields. You can select up to 3 fields in a row or column by 
clicking on two different fields or you can select one by clicking on one field twice. 

Have fun !
